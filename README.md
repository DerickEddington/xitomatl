Personal collection of various Scheme (R6RS) libraries I created and others'
libraries I use and want organized in my own way.

The Xitomatl collection requires SRFI libraries conforming to SRFI-97.  The SRFI
libraries used by the author can be found at
http://github.com/DerickEddington/srfi

Scheme systems that can be supported are those that support the `*.IMPL.sls`
convention for implementation-specific libraries.  A variety of Scheme systems
were supported but those haven't been tried in many years, and currently only
Ikarus is known to still work.  It probably would be straightforward to get Chez
and Larceny working.

See the test programs in the `tests/` folder for examples of how to use the
libraries.

This collection was originally hosted at
